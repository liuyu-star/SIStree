Description: The sure independence screening tree (SIStree) is a new approach for screening by partitioning the sample into subsets consecutively, leading to a tree structure of sub-samples. The sure independence screening forest (SISforest) is an ensemble o multiple SIStrees generated by sample bagging. Both can be used for variable screening as supplements to the classical CART of Breiman (1984) <https://imsarchives.nus.edu.sg/oldwww/Programs/014swclass/files/mark.pdf> and Random Forest of Breiman (2001) <DOI:10.1023/A:1010933404324> respectively.
